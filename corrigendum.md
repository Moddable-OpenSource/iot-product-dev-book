### Page 152

Listing 3-15 does not match the [`https-get` example](./ch3-network/https-get). The listing leaves out the `port` property in the dictionary passed to the `Request` constructor; it should be as follows:

```js
let request = new Request({
	host: "www.example.com",
	path: "/",
	response: String,
	Socket: SecureSocket,
	port: 443
});
```

### Page 159

Listing 3-21 returns `String` for the `Server.status` message instead of the `Server.headersComplete` message. The full corrected listing is as follows:

```
let server = new Server;

server.callback = function(msg, value, etc) {
	switch (msg) {
		case Server.status:
			if ("PUT" !== etc)
				this.close();
			return;

		case Server.headersComplete:
			return String;

		case Server.requestComplete:
			this.json = {
				error: "none",
				when: (new Date).toString(),
				request: JSON.parse(value)
			};
			break;

		case Server.prepareResponse:
			return {
				headers: ["Content-Type", "application/json"],
				body: JSON.stringify(this.json)
			};
	}
}
```

> To ask the HTTP `Server` class to deliver the request body in fragments, the callback returns `true` to the `prepareRequest` message. 
 
This sentence is incorrect. The callback returns true to the `headersComplete` message, not the `prepareRequest` message.

In addition, Listing 3-22 does not match the [`https-server-streaming-put` example](./ch3-network/http-server-streaming-put). The listing uses quotation marks instead of backticks in the first trace statement and the `prepareRequest` message instead of the `headersComplete` message; it should be as follows:

```js
let server = new Server;

server.callback = function(msg, value) {
	switch (msg) {
		case Server.status:
			trace(`\n ** begin upload to ${value} **\n`);
			break;

		case Server.headersComplete:		// prepare for request body
			return true;					// provide request body in fragments

		case Server.requestFragment:
			trace(this.read(String));
			break;

		case Server.requestComplete:
			trace("\n ** end of file **\n");
			break;
	}
}
```

The [`websocket-client` example](ch3-network/websocket-client) originally connected to the server at `echo.websocket.org`. This service is no longer available, so the example now connects to `websockets.chilkat.io`.

This code snippet on page 169 no longer matches the `websocket-client` example:

```js
let ws = new Client({
    host: "echo.websocket.org"
});
```

It should be as follows:

```js
let ws = new Client({
	host: "websockets.chilkat.io", 
	path: "/wsChilkatEcho.ashx"
});
```

In addition, the following sentence is no longer accurate:

> This process repeats indefinitely, with count increasing each time.

The server at `websockets.chilkat.io` limits each connection to a maximum of 16 echoed messages. After the 16th message, it disconnects from the client.

The **Creating Two-Way Communication** section explains how to use the Bluefruit mobile app to create a peripheral. However, the Bluefruit mobile app no longer has the **Peripheral Mode** feature described in the text, so the instructions in this section are no longer valid.

The [`text-server` example](./ch4-ble/text-server) may be used as a replacement  if you have a second ESP32 device. To use this example, follow these steps:

- Connect one of your ESP32 devices to your computer with a USB cable.

- Install the `text-server` example on the ESP32 using `mcconfig`.

	```text
	cd $EXAMPLES/ch4-ble/text-server
	mcconfig -m -p esp32
	```

- Disconnect the first ESP32 and connect the other ESP32.

- Install the `text-client` example as described in the book.

- Connect the first ESP32 to a power source.

The devices will automatically pair, and the `text-client` will subscribe to notifications from the `text-server` as described. However, instead of typing in messages and manually sending them from your phone, the `text-server` app will automatically sends a message every second.

In this example, the second parameter to `slice` is incorrect.

```
let r1 = new Resource("myData.dat");
let values = new Uint16Array(r1.slice(32, 10, false));
```

The second parameter is the end position of the slice, not the byte length of the slice. The correct code is:

```
let r1 = new Resource("myData.dat");
let values = new Uint16Array(r1.slice(32, 32 + 10, false));
```

The **Monitoring for Changes** section does not provide the import statement for the `Monitor` class used in Listing 6-5.

```js
import Monitor from "pins/digital/monitor";
```

> Figure 8-8 shows the same circle mask drawn in blue (which appears gray in printed versions of this book).

The comment in parentheses is incorrect. The book is published in color, though it was planned to be published in grayscale.
