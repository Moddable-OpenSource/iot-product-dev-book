## Moddable Six Support!
[Moddable Six](https://www.moddable.com/moddable-six) is an  advanced display powered by the ESP32-S3. It is fully compatible with the examples in our book. This powerful development board replaces Moddable Two. Moddable Six includes a built-in speaker, so you easily use the audio examples in Chapter 7. It also features a faster display, more responsive touch, more RAM, and larger flash storage.

## Nordic nRF52 Support!

The Moddable SDK 4.0 has added support for the Nordic nRF52 microcontroller. The ultra-low power nRF52 with integrated BLE allows projects to run on a coin cell battery.

The Moddable SDK APIs are compatible across ESP32, ESP8266, and nRF52 microcontrollers. Therefore, the majority of the content of our book applies to nRF52 too. However, networking (Chapter 3) and audio (chapter 6) are not available on nRF52.

[Moddable Four](https://www.moddable.com/moddable-four) is an nRF52 development board with BLE, a display, jog dial, and accelerometer. It is a great place to explore nRF52 development in JavaScript.
